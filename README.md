# EnergyEfficiency
This is a linear regression data science project using an energy efficiency data set from the UCI machine learning repository. We are using python packages for data visualizations and data modeling. 
We will predict heating load(HL) and cooling load(CL) for Energy efficient building designs. Our dataset contains 8 features that are the input variables (relative compactness (X1), surface area(X2), wall area(X3), roof area(X4), overall height(X5), orientation(X6), glazing area(X7) and area distribution(X8)
